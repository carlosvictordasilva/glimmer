Help people with heavy handicap to communicate though their eyes.
Glimmer is designed to allow immobile patients (due to ALS, SMA, stroke, spinal injury etc.) to communicate via eye movement.

Glimmer is a web application compatible with any devices (laptop, tablet...) and cameras.

Immobile patients due to spinal problems loses everything but their mind. They can understand what's going on around them and they can think as clearly as anybody else, but they cannot express themselves. Their soul is imprisoned in their body. Glimmer provides a glimmer of hope to allow them to communicate with the world through eye movements.

Glimmer tracks the patient's eye movements to provide simple communications with their families and with the world.

Glimmer was developed during the HK Hacking Health hackathon 2014, and won both the jury's and audience's prices.
It is an open-source project - feel free to contribute! Contact us for additional information.

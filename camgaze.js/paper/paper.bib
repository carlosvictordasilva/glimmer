    abstract = {Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) can affect up to 20\%-30\% of
        patients with mild closed head injury (mCHI), comprising incomplete
            recovery and debilitating persistence of post-concussional
            symptoms. Eye movements relate closely to the functional integrity
            of the injured brain and eye movement function is impaired
            post-acutely in mCHI. Here, we examined whether PCS patients
            continue to show disparities in eye movement function at 3-5 months
            following mCHI compared with patients with good recovery. We
            hypothesized that eye movements might provide sensitive and
            objective functional markers of ongoing cerebral impairment in PCS.
            We compared 36 PCS participants (adapted World Health Organization
                    guidelines) and 36 individually matched controls (i.e. mCHI
                        patients of similar injury severity but good recovery)
                    on reflexive, anti- and self-paced saccades, memory-guided
                    sequences and smooth pursuit. All completed
                    neuropsychological testing and health status
                    questionnaires. Mean time post-injury was 140 days in the
                    PCS group and 163 days in the control group. The PCS group
                    performed worse on anti-saccades, self-paced saccades,
        memory-guided sequences and smooth pursuit, suggesting problems in
            response inhibition, short-term spatial memory, motor-sequence
            programming, visuospatial processing and visual attention. This
            poorer oculomotor performance included several measures beyond
            conscious control, indicating that subcortical functionality in the
            PCS group was poorer than expected after mCHI. The PCS group had
            poorer neuropsychological function (memory, complex attention and
                    executive function). Analysis of covariance showed
            oculomotor differences to be practically unaffected by group
            disparities in depression and estimated intellectual ability.
            Compared with neuropsychological tests, eye movements were more
            likely to be markedly impaired in PCS cases with high symptom load.
            Poorer eye movement function, and particularly poorer subcortical
            oculomotor function, correlated more with post-concussive symptom
            load and problems on activities of daily living whilst poorer
            neuropsychological function exhibited slightly better correlations
            with measures of mental health. Our findings that eye movement
            function in PCS does not follow the normal recovery path of eye
            movements after mCHI are indicative of ongoing cerebral impairment.
            Whilst oculomotor and neuropsychological tests partially overlapped
            in identifying impairment, eye movements showed additional
            dysfunction in motor/visuospatial areas, response inhibition,
        visual attention and subcortical function.  Poorer subconscious
            oculomotor function in the PCS group supports the notion that PCS
            is not merely a psychological entity, but also has a biological
            substrate. Measurement of oculomotor function may be of value in
            PCS cases with a high symptom load but an otherwise unremarkable
            assessment profile. Routine oculomotor testing should be feasible
            in centres with existing access to this technology.},

@article{Wade2010, abstract = {Recent advances in the technology affording eye
    movement recordings carry the risk of neglecting past achievements. Without
        the assistance of this modern armoury, great strides were made in
        describing the ways the eyes move. For Aristotle the fundamental
        features of eye movements were binocular, and he described the combined
        functions of the eyes. This was later given support using simple
        procedures like placing a finger over the eyelid of the closed eye and
        culminated in Hering's law of equal innervation.  However, the
        overriding concern in the 19th century was with eye position rather
        than eye movements. Appreciating discontinuities of eye movements arose
        from studies of vertigo. The characteristics of nystagmus were recorded
        before those of saccades and fixations. Eye movements during reading
        were described by Hering and by Lamare in 1879; both used similar
        techniques of listening to sounds made during contractions of the
        extraocular muscles. Photographic records of eye movements during
        reading were made by Dodge early in the 20th century, and this
        stimulated research using a wider array of patterns. In the mid-20th
        century attention shifted to the stability of the eyes during fixation,
                with the emphasis on involuntary movements. The contributions
                    of pioneers from Aristotle to Yarbus are outlined.}, author
